## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Perform a **read-only**, comprehensive audit of the currently implemented code against the project's specification and design documents. The goal is to detect implementation bugs, deviations from the spec, and design ambiguities before the feature is considered complete.

## Operating Constraints

1.  **READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files (code or docs).
2.  **Strict Prerequisite**: This command **MUST ABORT** if `tasks.md` does not exist OR if zero tasks are marked as completed (`[x]`).
3.  **Scope**: Focus ONLY on the tasks marked as completed in `tasks.md` and their corresponding code. Do not hallucinate errors for unstarted tasks.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Prerequisite Check & Context Loading

1.  Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` to get paths.
2.  **Task Status Validation**:
    *   Parse `tasks.md`.
    *   Count total tasks and completed tasks (marked with `[x]` or `[X]`).
    *   **CRITICAL**: If completed tasks count is **0**, output: "⛔ **ABORT**: No tasks have been marked as completed in `tasks.md`. Please run `/speckit.implement` or manually mark tasks as done before verifying." and **STOP execution**.
3.  **Load Artifacts**:
    *   Read `spec.md` (Requirements, User Stories, Edge Cases).
    *   Read `plan.md` (Architecture, Tech Stack).
    *   Read `data-model.md` (Entities).
    *   Read `quickstart.md` (Integration Scenarios & Usage Examples).
    *   Read ALL files under the `contracts/` directory.
    *   Read `tasks.md` (to identify which files have been modified/created).

### 2. Codebase Analysis (Targeted)

1.  Identify **Modified Files**: Extract file paths mentioned in the *completed* tasks within `tasks.md`.
2.  **Read Code**: Load the actual content of these implementation files from the repository.
3.  **Traceability Mapping**:
    *   Map Code Component $\leftrightarrow$ Task ID $\leftrightarrow$ User Story $\leftrightarrow$ Functional Requirement.

### 3. Verification Logic

Perform a deep analysis comparing the **Code** against the **Docs**. Check for:

#### A. Implementation Integrity (Code vs. Spec)
*   **Functionality**: Does the code actually perform the logic described in the User Story?
*   **Data Integrity**: Do the implemented models/schemas match `data-model.md` exactly? (Check field names, types, constraints).
*   **API Compliance**: Do the implemented endpoints/interfaces match the definitions found in **all `contracts/` files**?
*   **Usage Consistency**: Does the code align with the usage examples provided in `quickstart.md`?
*   **Edge Cases**: Does the code handle the "Edge Cases" listed in `spec.md`? (e.g., error handling, null states).

#### B. Design Consistency (Spec vs. Plan vs. Code)
*   **Architecture**: Does the code follow the structure defined in `plan.md`?
*   **Ambiguity**: Did the implementation require guessing because the Spec was vague?
*   **Omissions**: Are there requirements in `spec.md` that should have been implemented in the completed tasks but are missing?

### 4. Report Generation

Output a **Concise Verification Report**. Do not dump raw logs. Use the structure below.

---

## Verification Report: [FEATURE NAME]

**Status**: [PASS / FAIL / WARN]
**Progress**: [X]/[Y] Tasks Verified

### 1. Critical Discrepancies (Action Required)
*List implementation errors where code contradicts the spec.*

| Severity | Component/File | Issue | Spec Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CRITICAL** | `src/models/user.ts` | Missing `email` validation field required by data model. | `data-model.md` Entity: User |
| **HIGH** | `src/api/auth.py` | Error 401 returns HTML instead of JSON. | `contracts/openapi.yaml` |
| **HIGH** | `src/cli/main.py` | CLI arguments do not match the example commands. | `quickstart.md` |

*(If none, display "✅ No critical implementation discrepancies found.")*

### 2. Specification & Design Gaps
*List areas where the code works, but the spec/design was unclear or flawed.*

*   **[Ambiguity]**: The spec didn't define the max file size for uploads. Implemented as 5MB default. Is this correct?
*   **[Inconsistency]**: `plan.md` called for PostgreSQL, but code uses SQLite syntax in migration files.

### 3. Code Quality & Edge Cases
*   **Edge Case Coverage**: [High/Medium/Low] - *Brief comment (e.g., "Null checks present, but timeout handling missing").*
*   **Test Coverage Check**: *Did the plan require tests? Do they exist for the completed files?*

### 4. Recommendations
*   [Short bullet point on what to fix in code]
*   [Short bullet point on what to update in spec/plan]

---

## Final Instruction

If **CRITICAL** issues are found, advise the user to fix the code or update the spec before proceeding.
If only **Spec Gaps** are found, advise running `/speckit.clarify` or updating the spec manually.
If **PASS**, confirm the implementation is solid so far.
